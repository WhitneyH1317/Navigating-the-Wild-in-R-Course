### data

Dataset including the patch size for every location of roe and red deer location dataset.

```{r message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
ce <- read.csv2('../data/2_patchsize/red.csv',dec = ',')
ca <- read.csv2('../data/2_patchsize/roe.csv',dec = ',')
head(ce)
head(ca)
```

### Apply patch_stat function
```{r message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# CALCULATE NUMBER OF PATCHES AND NUMBER OF FIXES IN A PATCH SMALLER THAN 25 HECTARE 
patch_ce_l <- patch_statistics(ce, patchsize = 250000)
patch_ca_l <- patch_statistics(ca, patchsize = 250000)
```

### nr of small patches  

First, we calculated the number of patches per individual. 
Then we sum up all the patches over all populations per species. 

```{r message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# NR OF PATCHES 
patch_nr_ce <- patch_ce_l[[1]] 
patch_nr_ce$species <- 'red'
patch_nr_ca <- patch_ca_l[[1]] 
patch_nr_ca$species <- 'roe'

patch_nr <- rbind(patch_nr_ce,patch_nr_ca)
patch_nr <- melt(patch_nr, id=c("species","animals_id")) 

# STATISTICS ABOUT NR OF PATCHES PER INDIVIDUAL OVER ALL POPULATIONS PER SPECIES 
(r <- group_by(patch_nr, species, variable) %>% 
    summarise(sum = sum(value), 
              mean= mean(value), 
              median=median(value), 
              max=max(value),
              min=min(value)))
barplot(r$sum, 
        cex.names=0.6,
        names.arg=c(paste0(r$species, ' ' , r$variable)), 
        main='total number of patches over all population')
```

### nr of fixes in patches < 25 hectares 

First, we calculated the proportion of fixes that is in a patch smaller than 25 hectare, for each individual. 
Then, we calculate the mean of that proportion over all populations (and thus all individuals)

```{r message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
patch_fx_ce <- patch_ce_l[[2]]
patch_fx_ce$species <- 'red'
patch_fx_ca <- patch_ca_l[[2]] 
patch_fx_ca$species <- 'roe'

patch_fx <- rbind(patch_fx_ce,patch_fx_ca)
(r <- group_by(patch_fx, species, variable) %>% 
    summarise(mean= mean(Freq), 
              median=median(Freq), 
              max=max(Freq),
              min=min(Freq)))
barplot(r$mean, 
        cex.names=0.6,
        names.arg=c(paste0(r$species, ' ', r$variable)), 
        main='mean proportion of fixes in small patches (<25ha) per individual over all populations')
#boxplot(Freq ~ species + variable, data=patch_fx, cex.axis=0.6, main='proportion of fixes in small patches (<25 ha) per individual')
pirateplot(Freq ~ variable  + species, data=patch_fx, cex.axis=0.6, main='proportion of fixes in small patches (<25 ha) per individual')
```
